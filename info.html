          <h3>Mischievous MANDELA</h3>
            <p>Actually,There's a story behind it,
            at my first semester i guess, i haven't attended for my internals. so, my H.O.D
            was searching for me. And he saw me roaming ok? He's right behind the bus, and me and my boys were
            pretending like some random stud boys in city who's photo bombing.So that he couldn't notice us.
             YEAH,This picture's caught at that time!!

                <h3>First Day at University-2018</h3>
                  <p>A College is dreamland of every student’s educational life and career
                  College life is a world of one’s own choice. Each moment spent in a college is worth-living,
                  worth-enjoyable and worth-remembering. The first day at college is really very special and
                  memorable for every student. My first day at College was very unique.
                  In fact, the joys and freedom that were a dream in School became a reality in college.</p>

    <u> <h3>My Favorites</h3> </u>
    <p><p>   <h5> FAVORITE COLOR-</h5>  People who choose black as their favorite color are often artistic and sensitive. While these people aren't introverts either extroverts, they are careful with the details of their lives and do not share easily with others.
  black is seen by people as a colour of strength, power, status, seriousness, elegance and even prestige. These are some of the most common things. Why Do I like Black Colour? </p>


  <h5> <p>FAVORITE BOOK- </h5> Uhmn, i love reading books all time.. I've many collections too. my favorite book of all time is "THE 5 AM CLUB" by ROBIN SHARMA

I have the entire collection of his books, and personally, I have been benefitted in every walk of my life.</p>
  <p>i really like this particular line in this book,
  "ALL CHANGE IS HARD AT FIRST, MESSY IN THE MIDDLE AND GORGEOUS AT THE END".</p>

   <p><span data-toggle="tooltip"title="this is a tooltip" class="text-info">12 RULES FOR LIFE</span> - 12 Rules for Life is an interesting book. Equal parts philosophy, psychology, and self-help book, it covers a broad range of topics, with Peterson drawing from life experiences, religion, and history to build a strong case for his points and provide what seems on its surface to be very good advice for people.</p>

    <u><h3>My Astrological Sign</h3> </u>
    <p><h5>Sagittarius's best traits:</h5> </p>
    Sagittarians are optimistic, lovers of freedom, hilarious, fair-minded, honest and intellectual. They are spontaneous and fun, usually with a lot of friends, and are perhaps the best conversationalists in the zodiac

    <p> <h5>Weaknesses:</h5> </p> Inability to fulfill promises, lacks patience, lack of tact. Sagittarius likes: Independency, journey, philosophy, outdoor activities.

    <p> <h5> Why is Sagittarius the best sign? </h5> </p>
    Sagittarians often have positive impacts on the lives of those around them. We make amazing friends and even better romantic partners. Life is never boring with a Sagittarius, as we are the most active sign of the zodiac chart. </p>
