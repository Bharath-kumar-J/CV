        <h2>MY SELF HELP STORY</h2>
        <p> Imagine your mind is like a garden and your thoughts are the seeds.
          You get to choose what seeds you plant in your garden.
          You can plant a seed of positivity,love and abundance. Or you can plant
          seeds of negativity, fear and shame. You can spend time trying to take care
          of everyone else's garden. Or you can work on making yours beautiful and
          attract other beautiful people into your garden.
          <p>SO,WHAT SEEDS ARE YOU PLANTING??</p>
          REMEMBER,
        "YOU ONLY LIVE ONCE, BUT IF YOU DO IT RIGHT, ONCE IS ENOUGH".
           .</p>

    <h4>Self Introduction :P</h4>
  <h6> <p>MITHUN here,I am from chennai.currently pursuing Btech in Electronics and communications
     Engineering from sathyabama university
which is affiliated by deemed university with 8.2 CGPA  till 4th semester.
I did my intermediate from sri chaithanya jr college with 94%
and schooling from sri chaithanya SCHOOL with 80%.I chose this branch because
I always wanted to work for an IT Firm and to enhance my skills,
I started learning courses on python and other skill sets from Coursera, nptel and many other sites.
I also achieved Python skill certificate from hackerrank.
I have good communication skills and can easily interact with new people.
My strength is self-motivation.
My weakness is I feel uncomfortable until I finish my work.My short-term goal is
 to get a job in a reputed company.
My long-term goal is after getting a job to increase the graph of the company with my effort and skills.
and my hobbies are reading books, composing musics, ignoring people as hell.
That's all about me.
Thank you.</p> </h6>

What i've learnt is,
<ul>
  <li>Time heals almost everything.</li>
    <li>Make peace with your past.</li>
      <li>Don't compare yourself to others and judge them, Stop thinking too much.</li>
    </ul>
